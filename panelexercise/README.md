Instructions:

	In the resources/data folder there are 100 data files.  Your task is to write a program that will find all of the unique words used in the 100 data files and sort them in descending order by frequency of occurrence.

Mission Parameters:

	Acceptable programming languages: Java or Kotlin (JDK 8+)

	3rd Party Libraries: Minimal (Spring injection okay, Junit okay)

	Output should be a file containing each unique word sorted by count (descending order) and prefaced with the number of times it occurs in the data files.  Example:

	1200    lorum
	856	ipsum
	13	foo

Additional Notes:
    
	1. Please ignore capitalization.  For instance, "Ipsum" and "ipsum" should be considered the same word.
	2. Please ignore punctuation.  For instance, ",ipsum", "ipsum.", and "ipsum, ", should all resolve to the same word "ipsum".

Scoring:

	Code will be evaluated for the following:

	Correctness
	Elegance
	Maintainability (readability)
	Parallel Solution (threading)
	Speed (performance)
